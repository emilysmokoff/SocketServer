# SocketServer

This was assignment for INFO 314. The goal was to write a QOTD Server that can simultaneously handle TCP Client request and UDP Client Requests. Here is a description of the files:
- PracticeSocketServer: The QOTD Server that handles the TCP Client Requests and the UDP Client Requests simultaneously. It hands out my favorite movie quotes, as well as quotes from The Princess Bride which was a requirement.

- SocketClient: My TCP Client class that I used to send requests to PracticeSocketServer from.

- UDPClient: My UDP Client class that I used to send requests to PracticeSocketServer from.
